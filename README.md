# IronHack-Lab4-AppSecurity - Implementing and Testing Application Security
This lab is designed to deepen participants’ understanding of application security by applying the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired about SAST, DAST, cryptography, and secure data communications.

## Scenarios for Security Design:

### Scenario 1: Pseudo-Code for Authentication System

#### Pseudo-Code Example:
```
FUNCTION authenticateUser(username, password):
  QUERY database WITH username AND password
  IF found RETURN True
  ELSE RETURN False
```

#### Security Scanning Report: 


### Scenario 2: JWT Authentication Schema

#### Design Outline

```
DEFINE FUNCTION generateJWT(userCredentials):
  IF validateCredentials(userCredentials):
    SET tokenExpiration = currentTime + 3600 // Token expires in one hour
    RETURN encrypt(userCredentials + tokenExpiration, secretKey)
  ELSE:
    RETURN error
```

### Scenario 3: Secure Data Communication Plan

#### Outline for Data Protection:
```
PLAN secureDataCommunication:
  IMPLEMENT SSL/TLS for all data in transit
  USE encrypted storage solutions for data at rest
  ENSURE all data exchanges comply with HTTPS protocols
```
